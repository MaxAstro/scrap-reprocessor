# Scrap Reprocessor
 
In an attempt to make late-stage Fulgora builds more interested and reward the player for mastering the planet, this mod adds a powerful new option for processesing scrap once you have electromagnetic science packs. The mod's goal is to introduce new and interesting automation challenges that reward smart setups by giving higher yields than normal scrap recycling.

# Features

The scrap reprocessor is a beastly scrap-devouring machine. Belt fed and able to keep up with a full red belt at regular speed, it pressure washes and automatically sorts scrap. This sorted scrap has a higher recycler yield, or can be fed into another reprocessor for even more output. The waste water from the process - a delightful slurry of Fulgoran minerals - can also be separated at a chemical plant into stone, reclaimed water, and holmium solution, providing a much better rate of solution than simply recycling scrap for holmium ore.

Better yet, the reprocessor's sorting process often turns up higher quality bits of scrap - the building has an innate quality bonus, even if no modules are installed. It also has a full six module slots and unlike the recycler is able to use productivity modules (although many setups will want to use quality modules).

Of course, this new process is not without its challenges. The reprocessor is power-hungry compared to recyclers and although its processes are on the whole water-neutral as long as you process the waste slurry, it doesn't itself output ice so you will need to import the initial water (and any water your other machines need) from elsewhere. The innate quality bonus can also be a curse in disguise, since the reprocessor's output has to be quality-sorted or your machines will jam.

The reprocessor is also a purpose-built machine; while it is very good at its job, it is not capable of general recycling like the recycler. It's scrap or nothing.

# Usage Notes

* Due to an engine limitation, the reprocessor's inbuilt loaders are not visible until the building is placed.
* When the machine is rotated or picked up, any items in the loaders are destroyed. I'm investigating a performant way to avoid this, but since the reprocessor's inputs and outputs are all filtered the loss should be minor.
* Many features of the mod can be customized in settings, including tweaking the reprocessor's outputs and quality bonus.
* The reprocessor does not output solid fuel. This is intentional. There's a whole ocean of the stuff.
