scrap-reprocessing-description=Unlocks the [item=scrap-reprocessor], a heavy-duty factory that pressure washes and sorts scrap. The resulting sorted scrap can then be recycled or fed into another reprocessor for a boosted yield, while the [fluid=mineral-slurry] byproduct can be separated into [item=stone] and [fluid=holmium-solution]. The reprocessor also has an innate quality bonus.
