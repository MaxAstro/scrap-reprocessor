[technology-name]
sr-scrap-reprocessing=Scrap reprocessing
sr-advanced-reprocessing=Advanced reprocessing

[technology-description]
sr-scrap-reprocessing=Unlocks the [entity=sr-scrap-reprocessor], a heavy-duty factory that pressure washes and sorts scrap. The resulting sorted scrap can then be recycled or fed into another reprocessor for a boosted yield, while the [fluid=sr-mineral-slurry] byproduct can be separated into [item=stone] and [fluid=holmium-solution]. The reprocessor also has an innate quality bonus.
sr-advanced-reprocessing=Unlocks a variety of new ways of using the reprocessor on planets other than Fulgora. Most recipes are complex, but take advantage of the reprocessor's high quality bonus.

[mod-setting-name]
scrap-reprocessor-quality-setting=Reprocessor base quality
scrap-reprocessor-architectural-setting=Architectural scrap outputs
scrap-reprocessor-mineral-slurry-setting=Mineral slurry doesn't output iron ore

[mod-setting-description]
scrap-reprocessor-quality-setting=Determines the innate quality bonus of the scrap reprocessor.
scrap-reprocessor-architectural-setting=Changes the output of architectural scrap.
scrap-reprocessor-mineral-slurry-setting=Removes iron ore as a byproduct of mineral slurry. This makes slurry processing simpler but makes it impossible to craft concrete using reprocessors.

[string-mod-setting-description]
scrap-reprocessor-quality-setting-none=Removes the base quality boost of the scrap reprocessor and the Quality 3 technology requirement. Don't like having to sort out quality scrap, huh?
scrap-reprocessor-quality-setting-vanilla=The scrap reprocessor has a base quality of 10%, keeping in line with vanilla's lower quality values.
scrap-reprocessor-quality-setting-boosted=The scrap reprocessor has a base quality of 20%. Pairs well with mods that make quality modules stronger.
scrap-reprocessor-architectural-setting-default=Architectural scrap will recycle into low density structure, stone brick, and iron sticks. Scrap reprocessing will be water-neutral overall.
scrap-reprocessor-architectural-setting-vanilla=Architectural scrap will have the vanilla scrap outputs of low density structure, concrete, and ice.
scrap-reprocessor-architectural-setting-hybrid=Reprocessing architectural scrap will produce the default outputs, while recycling it will produce the vanilla-like outputs.
scrap-reprocessor-architectural-setting-boosted=Architectural scrap will have the default outputs, but produce extra mineral slurry to allow for net-positive water production.
